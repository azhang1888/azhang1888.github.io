            <strong> About Me: </strong> 
            Hello! I'm Anne Zhang, a fourth year Psychology major with minors in Creative Writing and Political Economics. In my spare time, I like writing video games and making PowerPoint presentations! My favorite animals are hippos and mandarin ducks. I'm sorry that my selfie is really big. Thanks for reading this!

            1. What is something you learned from this article?

            One thing I learned from this article was that web/app design considers the different experiences each user goes through. For example, AirBnB having London in the search bar could be a visual indicator for people who aren't as familiar with the app to know what this bar is for. It's a good reminder that not everyone processes information the same way.

            2. What was your favorite part of this article?

            My favorite part was when the author talked about copying designs when she had no idea why they worked. It helps emphasize her point of how we should analyze apps we engage with usually. Also, as a graphic designer, I definitely understand the impulse of wanting to create something visually stunning over what might be practical.

            A quote I thought was interesting was: "What content is visible and more interestingly, what content isn’t?"

            On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate this article a 9. I wish it went into more depth in some topics, but it was a comprehensive overview.
