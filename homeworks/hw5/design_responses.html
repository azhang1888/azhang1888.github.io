                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something I learned was there’s a variety of ways to communicate a design, but all good designs share similar tenets. For example, message animation and add to cart interaction serve different functions. However, both utilize white space and a clear color palette well to convey their functions.  </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part was how image focused it was. I also enjoyed the slight animation each one had. It was interesting to see how a user would engage with each of these interfaces.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite inspirations were the selected work transitions and AI-powered personal assistant. For the work transitions, I enjoyed how fluidly and cleanly the portfolio was displayed, which I think the interface achieved through clever use of white space. I liked the AI-powered personal assistant because the design is relatively simple. The designer achieved their goal through the use of two main colors, black to indicate the background and blue to signal interactivity. Also, the interface felt simple and quiet, which was important as the AI was intended to be voice-activated, so avoiding visual clutter was helpful. </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 8, because while I liked the inspiration, I wish the article itself linked the designs directly, so I could read more about the thought-process each designer had. It was slightly inconvenient to scroll through the designer’s entire portfolio, looking for one specific piece of work. </p>
