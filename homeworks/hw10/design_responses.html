							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> My thoughts are mostly that the study of attention is complex and viewing it as a limited resource explains, cognitively, why a lot of design trends are moving towards more minimalistic designs. These influenced my opinion on design, because I personally enjoy complicated designs. However, understanding the psychological processes behind attention is helpful to understand that quantity may not be quality. Some interesting examples were the Cocktail Party Effect and Change Blindness, because both sought to explain how selective attention is. 							</p>
