				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Something I learned was how broad dark patterns are. Previously, I assumed dark patterns were just when users cannot easily delete their accounts. Now, I understand how many design choices I found frustrating are intentionally bad. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part was when the author explains various dark patterns. I’ve heard about dark patterns before, especially on websites like Amazon. However, I liked learning about forced continuity and roach motel, as although the bad intentions are obvious, there is no easy way to avoid this design. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> “Good design [...] has the user’s best interest in mind, and is not deceptive or sneaky in nature.” </p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a
							five, please briefly explain why.</p>
						<p> I give it a 10, because it acknowledges something startlingly common and explains why it’s not useful.  </p>
