							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned how to make my website color accessible. By adding contrast and focusing our color palettes, we can create more effective and long-lasting designs. In particular, as a psychology major, it’s one I’m passionate about and accessibility is a topic not often covered in design classes. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was how color systems should be documented. This allows everyone on the team to create cohesive, accessible designs. Additionally, I liked this because it also creates sustainability for the company’s design future. </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “As designers, developers, and general tech people, we have the power to create a web we’re all proud of: an inclusive web made for and consumable by all people.”</p>
