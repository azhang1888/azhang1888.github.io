					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> <img src="assets/imgs/wireframewebsite.png" alt=""> </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>

						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of this website is to showcase the art studioâ€™s work, to encourage companies to hire them and consumers to buy their merchandise. The original design accomplishes this by immediately placing their art behind any text the user hovers their mouse over.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> The issues I addressed in my redesign was space for text and how much art it was showcasing at a time. Because the emphasis was on a single piece of art at a time, a lot of important information, like how to contact the studio, were crammed together at the header and footer. My redesign combines categories to allow for more empty space and readability, as well as encouraging the viewer to scroll their entire portfolio instead of one piece at a time. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
