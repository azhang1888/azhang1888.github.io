					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned about this article was how white/empty space offers the audience time and space to process information. I used to think empty space, specifically when trying to convey information, was space that could be better utilized. However, seeing a professional UX designer advocate for white space as a means of organization and readability encouraged me to use empty space in my designs. </p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was when the author used contrasting examples of how the Wayfair product page was organized. For me, it served as a good visual example and emphasis of what he was talking about. Additionally, it also brought to mind websites I struggled to use in the past and helped me think of why it felt clustered.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Just as humans need air to breathe, designs need white space to breathe.” </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
