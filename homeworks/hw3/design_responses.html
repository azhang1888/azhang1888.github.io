					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned how font and legibility plays a role in designing for a specific audience. A lot of web design so far seems related to having an audience in mind and targeting your design to them (which makes sense), so it’s interesting to learn how there’s even fonts for different age groups. The Golden Ratio for fonts is also very helpful to learn about, as the article put into words something I always intuitively utilized in my designs.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was when the author discussed creating a style guide. I’ve created design and branding guidelines before, so the idea of recording font style as well as size across platforms is interesting as well. I especially liked how the author linked examples, which I’m excited to try. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Harmonize your type with the rest of your design.” </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I would give this article a 10, because it dives deeply into a subject most people don’t think about. </p>
