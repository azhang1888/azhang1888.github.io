					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned was that animation is only important if it draws attention and is unobtrusive. I alway assumed animation was for attention. However, I’m glad the author highlighted how successful animation is only if it doesn't distract the user. It really made me rethink how effective websites I found were “cool” in the past. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was the animated examples. It does a good job of illustrating why certain animations are bad, along with the written explanations. It also helps me visualize what’s going on as well as brainstorm on how to implement similar animations.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “If the animation is built correctly, then it is unobtrusive and does not distract the users from their goals.” </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I would rate this article a 9, because it was very informative and included other disciplines.  </p>
