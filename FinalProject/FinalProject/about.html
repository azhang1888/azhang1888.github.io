            <div id="heading">Take Breaks</div>
            <div id="info">The longer you work on something; the more likely you are to become accustomed to it. As a result, taking brief breaks can be helpful to your overall productivity. Breaks don’t just mean not doing anything, but it can mean doing other relaxing activities as well, like taking a walk or cooking. Breaks can also be doing another task, like washing the dishes. </div>    
        </li>
       
        <li>
            <div id="heading">Diversify Self-Care Habits</h2>
            <div id="info">If you become too reliant on one activity as self-care, then it may be difficult to relax when you can’t do that activity. For example, if your only self-care activity is art, then in instances where you can’t easily draw, you may feel more stressed because of it. By having a diversity of self-care habits, you ensure you have a variety of ways to destress and care for yourself.</div>

        <li>
            <div id="heading">Go Outside</div>
            <div id="info">Taking a breath of fresh air, going on a walk, or just even seeing nature can have a positive effect on clearing your mind. If you’re incredibly focused on a certain project or stressed out, then going outside—even briefly—can help you reorient yourself. </div>
        </li>
        

        <li> 
            <div id="heading">Take Care of Your Physical Needs</div>
            <div id="info">Along with other basic physical needs (eating, sleeping, etc.), you should make sure you’ve fulfilled each one. This includes social needs as well, such has speaking to a friend or romantic partner. It’s easy to forget to do simple tasks, like drinking water, so you can even set an alarm to remember those. </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div id="heading">Seek Help, if Necessary </div>
            <div id="info">Remember, you’re never alone. There’s always someone, loved ones and mental health professionals, who are willing to help you. If you feel like you can't face a stressor alone, then you don't have to. Reach out to someone  you trust!</div>
